## 🧠 Model Variants

- **CBM_MC**: Concept Bottleneck Model trained on multi-concept annotations for Main-Class classification.
- **CBM_SC_MC_type1/2**: Variants of Sub-Class Main-Class classification using multi-concept annotations (end-to-end joint training).
- **Swin_MC**: Vision Transformer-based Swin model trained for Main-Class classification.

## 📦 Metadata

- `Skin_Metadata.csv`: Per-image metadata including demographics and quality flags.
- `train/test_split.csv`: Official splits used for training and evaluation.
- `Metadata_schema.md`: Documentation of metadata column definitions.

## 🚀 Training Scripts

Each training script corresponds to a specific model variant. Modify the script arguments or configs inside the script as needed.

## 📒 Inference

Use the `Infer_CBM_MC.ipynb` and `Infer_Swin_MC.ipynb` notebooks to run inference and analyze prediction results.
